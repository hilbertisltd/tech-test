## Web Developer Role - Code Test

Thank you for applying to Hilbert Investment Solutions!

As part of the application process we would like you to complete a short technical challenge to assist in our evaluation. Your solution will be discussed further at the interview stage, along with any other thoughts you have about this exercise.

## Test 1

### Description

The objective is to build a simple web tool that:
1. Presents a set of open Action Items to the user,
2. Allows the user to pick one and "Choose File" it by uploading a file from their computer,
3. Marks that Action Item as "File uploaded" and stores the corresponding file provided. (Changes status of File not uploaded)

The Items should be seeded from the [given data file](./test_data.json), and
displayed / represented by the given id number and text, as well as
their status and the attached file (if the Action Item is done).

It should be possible in principle to retrieve the files stored against the corresponding items,
but the UI to do so is out of scope of this exercise ( Not necessary for any extra work for UI).

### Implementation

You are free to implement this using whatever frameworks, technologies and programming languages
you feel appropriate. There is no time limit on how long you can spend on the task, but have in
mind that we evaluate the answers in a FCFS order.

The objectives of the exercise are for you to:
- Demonstrate good choices of frameworks, languages and technologies in regard to:
  - suitability to the given task
  - avoiding large amounts of unnecessary programming
  - the technologies we already use, i.e. the skills we are looking for in the job advert
- Demonstrate the ability to use the chosen frameworks, languages and technologies effectively,
  including configuration and test writing
- Demonstrate awareness of the kinds of issues that arise using such technologies for such an
  application - write them in the README.md file for discussion during the interview.

During the interview at the next stage, we will discuss about the overall quality of your solution
as well as specific aspects as:

- Simplicity,
- Readability,
- Scalability,
- Maintainability


### Submission

Your work should be submitted as a Git repository. If hosted publicly, please don't mention the
interview in the repo or code, unless you feel comfortable making it public you're interviewing
with us.

Include any notes, comments, and known issues and considerations in a README.md file.

In particular, you should document how to **run your submission** and if it relies on any external
dependencies, what those are and how to set them up.

Good luck! Have fun!
