Thank you for applying to HIlbert Investment Solutions!

As part of the application process we would like you to complete a short technical challenge
to assist in our evaluation. Your solution will be discussed further at the interview stage,
along with any other thoughts you have about this exercise.

## Task-2

### Description

The objective is create a CSS file for a web page that:

1. Implements a given wireframe spec,
2. Uses Responsive Design to appear optimally on a wide range of devices and screen sizes,
3. Showcases some of your favourite techniques for making a page dynamic and engaging!

The web page in question is [Tech Test 2/example.html](./example.html),


The wireframe spec is [Tech Test 2/wireframe.png](./wireframe.png).

### Implementation

You are free to implement this using whatever framework you feel appropriate, or none.
There is no time limit on how long you can spend on the task, but have in mind that we
evaluate the answers in a FCFS order.

The objectives of the exercise are for you to:
- Demonstrate good choices of frameworks and techniques in regard to:
  - suitability to the given task,
  - usefulness on a large project with extensive and sophisticated styling needs.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the chosen frameworks and techniques effectively,
  showing an understanding of cross-browser and cross-device issues, and graceful degradation.
- Demonstrate awareness of the kinds of issues that arise using such technologies for such an
  application - write them in the README.md file for some explanation .
- Demonstrate possible additional enhancements you might suggest as a creative developer to
  improve the solution, e.g. extra functionality or ways to make the page seem more "alive".

During the interview at the next stage, we will discuss about the overall quality of your solution
as well as specific aspects as:
- Simplicity,
- Readability,
- Scalability,
- Maintainability,
- User Appeal - the Wow! factor...

### Submission

Your work should be submitted as a Git repository. If hosted publicly, please don't mention the
interview in the repo or code, unless you feel comfortable making it public you're interviewing
with us.

Ensure that your solution can be viewed straight-away by ensuring there is a file in it called
'example.html', which displays your solution when opened locally in a browser. If your solution
requires a build, please ensure there are full build instructions included to build it.

Include any notes, comments, and known issues and considerations in a README.md file.

Good luck! Have fun!
